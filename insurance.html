      <h2>Insurance</h2>
      <hr class="line">
      <p>As we are prone to a variety of risks from health to finance, insurances can be taken out in order to offer protection from these uncertainties from occurring. There are a variety of benefits of taking out insurance policies such as:
      <br>
        <ul class="services">
          <li>Provide safety and security to an individual or businesses</li>
          <li>Provide protection to your assets and finance by generating long-term financial resources</li>
          <li>Provide support to your family during health-related emergencies</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Here at Royale Standards, we have access to specialist advisors who have access to the protection market area, such as Cardiff Money advisors, who can help find the best insurance policy to cater for your needs. </p>

      <h2>Types of Insurance</h2>
      <hr>
      <button class="collapsible">Life Assurance Protection</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Are you looking for life assurance to help protect your loved ones?</strong>
        <br>We can help give professional advice regarding the best life assurance policies to make sure your family is protected in the event of your death, by putting you into contact with trusted insurers.
        <br>For life assurance protection, you choose the amount of cover you need and the length of time you want to be insured for. Your premiums will never change (unless you change the amount of cover held under the policy or alter the plan), allowing you to budget with confidence.</p>

        <p><strong>Mortgage Life Protection</strong>
        <br>Help protect your home and your loved ones, with mortgage life insurance.
        <br>No one ever plans to get sick or die unexpectedly. We always think that it won’t happen to us, but the reality is that it could happen at any time. It’s not a fun subject to think about, but it has to be considered if you’re taking on a mortgage, or increasing your mortgage, as it’s such a life changing commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>Critical Illness Cover</strong>
        <br>We never think a critical illness is going to happen to us, especially when we feel healthy, but it can and does. What if it did happen to you? Imagine if you were critically ill and unable to work for a long time…… could you manage financially?</p>

        <p><strong>Accident, Sickness and Unemployment</strong>
        <br>(ASU) cover Accident, Sickness and Unemployment cover provides security and peace of mind should you be unable to work for these reasons. Irrespective of your job or nature of your contract, we have one premium for all cases.</p>

      <button class="collapsible">Specialist Insurance</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The Lloyd’s market insures complex and specialist risks – from oil rigs to celebrity body parts.</p>
        <p><strong>Casualty</strong>
        <br>Casualty risks are particularly specialist and complex and the US accounts for a large proportion of this business. This market includes professional indemnity, medical malpractice, accident and health, directors' & officers' liability and general and employers’ liability. Casualty makes up 20% of Lloyd’s business.</p>

        <p><strong>Property</strong>
        <br>The property sector is hugely varied, encompassing everything from supporting the building of the new World Trade Center to protecting holiday resorts against storm damage. It’s also highly competitive with capacity increasing as many insurers look to diversify away from the catastrophe business. Property makes up 23% of Lloyd’s business.</p>

        <p><strong>Marine</strong>
        <br>This is where the Lloyd’s story began over 300 years ago. Today it is a smaller but still significant part of our business. Most of the cover in this area is for hull, cargo, marine, liability and specie (the insurance of highly valued items such as fine art while in transit). Marine makes up 7% of Lloyd’s business.</p>

        <p><strong>Energy</strong>
        <br>This market is steadily evolving, from onshore and offshore property, oil rigs and refineries to emerging renewable energy ventures. Energy makes up 6% of Lloyd’s business.</p>

        <p><strong>Motor</strong>
        <br>In this competitive sector, Lloyd’s is focused on company fleet business and non-standard risks. This includes high value, vintage and collectors’ vehicles, high risk drivers and affinity groups. Lloyd’s has insured numerous land speed record attempts and Sir Malcolm Campbell, the first man to break 300mph on land, was a Lloyd’s broker. Motor makes up 5% of Lloyd’s business.</p>

        <p><strong>Aviation</strong>
        <br>Lloyd’s is an industry leader within the global aviation market. This includes airline, general aviation, products, war and terrorist coverage, airports and satellite business. Since 9/11, this sector’s loss experience has been well below the industry’s long-term average, thanks to new safety systems, increased security and improved regulation. Aviation makes up 3% of Lloyd’s business.</p>

        <p><strong>Reinsurance</strong>
        <br>The reasons for reinsurance tend to fall into four categories: to protect an insurer against very large claims; to reduce exposure to peaks and troughs; to obtain an international spread of risk; and to increase the capacity of the direct insurer. Reinsurance makes up 36% of Lloyd’s business.</p>
