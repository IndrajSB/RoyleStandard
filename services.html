      <button class="collapsible">Asset Based Finance</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Asset based lending incorporates the following four key areas and is aimed at generating cashflow within a business to enable expansion or simply to ensure the company has a healthy cashflow available:</p>
        <p>
          <ul class="services">
            <li>Asset Finance</li>
            <li>Invoice Factoring</li>
            <li>Invoice Discounting</li>
            <li>Leasing options</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Royale Standard Asset Finance - Enables purchase or refinance of company assets</p>
        <p>Asset finance enables companies to obtain funding for the purchase of assets they need to run & grow their businesses successfully. Paying cash outright for capital assets can be a significant drain on your company's working capital. With asset finance you will ease your cash flow through regular payments over an agreed period of time.</p>
        <p>This can be secured against a whole host of assets including cars, vans, lorries, coaches, light & heavy commercial vehicles, plant, machinery & office equipment to name but a few.</p>

        <p>Royale Standard Invoice Factoring - Increases cashflow within a business</p>
        <p>Factoring can offer many benefits to your business. Many companies use it to reduce the overheads of their own accounts department. Others use it to generate cash, which can be used to expand their business, increase distribution, or simply relieve short-term creditor pressure.</p>
        <p>Factoring can provide the freedom you may have been looking for your invoices act as security, so there is no need to pledge any personal or business assets to increase cashflow. It will also allow you to keep your debtors under control, enabling you to react to your target market quicker & obtain new customers, pay employees or just rest easy knowing your cashflow is under control.</p>
        <p>There is no need to keep increasing your borrowing as with overdrafts & bank loans as all finance is raised per invoice (up to 90%) so funding increases with company turnover. Minimum projected turnovers apply, individual providers differ.</p>
        <p>How does it work? - An advance is made on your invoice value(s) up to 90%, the lender will then collect the debt, taking over your credit control & you will receive the balance of funds, less any charges, once the invoice has been paid.</p>

        <p>Royale Standard Invoice Discounting - Increases cashflow within a business</p>
        <p>Is exactly the same as Invoice factoring however you are in charge of credit control. An advance is made on your invoice value(s), then you manage the debt collection in order to repay the advance & any associated fees within an agreed timescale.</p>
        <p>All fees are subject to individual circumstances & the number of debtors on the companies books.</p>

        <p>Royale Standard Leasing Options - Secured against assets</p>
        <p>
          <ul class="services">
            <li>Finance leasing</li>
            <li>Hire/lease purchase</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The acquisition of assets - particularly expensive capital equipment - is a major commitment for many businesses. How that acquisition is funded requires careful planning.</p>
        <p>Rather than pay for the asset outright using cash, it can often make sense for businesses to look for ways of spreading the cost of acquiring an asset, to coincide with the timing of the revenue generated by the business. The most common sources of medium term finance for investment in capital assets are Hire Purchase and Leasing.</p>
        <p>Leasing and hire purchase are financial facilities which allow a business to use an asset over a fixed period, in return for regular payments. The business customer chooses the equipment it requires, and the finance company buys it on behalf of the business.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Bridging Finance</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>A bridging finance loan is interim financing for an individual or business until permanent or the next stage of financing can be obtained. Money from the new financing is generally used to "take out" (i.e. to pay back) the bridging finance loan, as well as other capitalization needs.</p>
        <p>Bridging finance loans are typically more expensive than conventional financing to compensate for the additional risk of the loan. Bridging finance loans typically have a higher interest rate, points and other costs that are amortized over a shorter period, and various fees and other "sweeteners" (such as equity participation by the lender in some loans). The lender also may require cross-collateralization and a lower loan-to-value ratio. On the other hand, they are typically arranged quickly with relatively little documentation.</p>
        <p>Examples in Real Estate</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>A bridging finance loan is often obtained by developers to carry a project while permit approval is sought. Because there is no guarantee the project will happen, the loan might be at a high interest rate and from a specialized lending source that will accept the risk. Once the project is fully entitled, it becomes eligible for loans from more conventional sources that are at lower interest, for a longer term, and in a greater amount. A construction loan would then be obtaine to take out the bridging finance loan and fund completion of the project.</li>
            <li>A consumer is purchasing a new residence and plans to make a down payment with the proceeds from the sale of a currently owned home. The currently owned home will not close until after the close of the new residence. A bridging finance loan allows the buyer to take equity out of the current home and use it as down payment on the new residence, with the expectation that the current home will close within a short time frame and the bridging finance loan will be repaid.</li>
            <li>A bridging finance loan can be used by a business to ensure continued smooth operation during a time when for example one senior partner wishes to leave whilst another wishes to continue the business. The bridging finance loan could be made based on the value of the company premises allowing funds to be raised via other sources for example a management buy in.</li>
            <li>A property may be offered at a discount if the purchaser can complete quickly with the discount off setting the costs of the short-term bridging finance loan used to complete. In auction property purchases where the purchaser has only 14–28 days to complete long term lending such as a buy to let mortgage may not be viable in that time frame whereas a bridging finance loan would be.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Examples In Corporate Finance</p>
        <p>Bridge finance loans are used in venture capital and other corporate finance for several purposes:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>To inject small amounts of cash to carry a company so that it does not run out of cash between successive major private equity financings</li>
            <li>To carry distressed companies while searching for an acquirer or larger investor (in which case the lender often obtains a substantial equity position in connection with the loan)</li>
            <li>As a final debt financing to carry the company through the immediate period before an initial public offering or an acquisition.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Example</p>
        <p>In December 2010, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and partners marketed a bridge loan for its upcoming acquisition of Del Monte Foods. As is common in such cases, KKR planned for the newly private company to borrow money by issuing corporate bonds. To ensure the money would be available, KKR sought $1.6B in bridge loan guarantees, for which it promised to pay 8.75% interest for 60 days and 11.75% thereafter. At KKR's option, these loans could then be replaced with eight-year corporate bonds (in effect, a put option) paying 11.75%. In return for the loans and guarantees, KKR was offering roughly 2% in fees.</p>

      <button class="collapsible">Mortgages</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>REPAYMENT MORTGAGE</p>
        <p>Interest on the loan and part of the capital is paid to the lender in the form of regular monthly instalments. In the early years, most of the payments are interest. The capital is paid off slowly in the latter years. The size of the loan therefore gradually decreases during the term of the mortgage.</p>
        <p>INTEREST ONLY MORTGAGE</p>
        <p>This type of mortgage’s aim is to provide a lump sum for you to pay off the mortgage at the end of the mortgage term. Interest on the loan is paid to the lender each month, while a cash sum is built up using an investment vehicle.</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Endowment</li>
            <li>Private Pension Plan</li>
            <li>Individual Savings Account (ISA)</li>
            <li>Unit Trust</li>
            <li>Single Investment Bond</li>
            <li>Saving Plan</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Royale Standard can assist you with introducing you to a professional (IFA) Independent Financial Advisor for advice for the correct investment product that may meet your needs.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Royale Standard must point out that both methods have advantages and disadvantages associated with them.</li>
            <li>You also need to be aware that with both a ‘repayment mortgage’ and an ‘interest only mortgage’ it is your responsibility to ensure that you maintain any such repayment vehicle for the term of the mortgage otherwise you may not be able to repay the debt at the end of the term, thus resulting in possible repossession of your home.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
        <p>REST</p>
        <p>The lenders may calculate the interest rate Daily, Monthly or Annually according to their product range.</p>

        <p>TERM</p>
        <p>The term is the period, usually in years, that a mortgage/re-mortgage has been arranged to be repaid over. This can generally be over a 25-year term period. However, it can vary with individual customer requirements. Lenders do allow borrowers to exceed their retirement age, should they have investment in place to cover Mortgage/Re-mortgage payments in their retirement.</p>
