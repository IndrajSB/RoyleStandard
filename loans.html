      <h2>2nd Charge Loans</h2>
      <hr class="line">
      <p>A secured loan is exactly what it says, a loan for which the lender requires security against property in the form of a land registry charge. These loans are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This charge takes second priority on the property after the first charge (usually a mortgage). A secured loan (sometimes also known as homeowner loan or second charge mortgage) can only be issued where clients have a first charge mortgage registered against their property. Where no mortgage is held, any secured borrowing taken out would take a first charge and therefore effectively be a mortgage.</p>
      <p>As a secured loan takes a separate charge over the property, it doesn’t affect the current mortgage. This is particularly useful where clients are happy with their current mortgage company and/or are unable to move away.</p>
