          <h2>Mortgage</h2>
          <hr class="line">
          <p>Mortgages are long term loans that are taken out in order to buy either a property or land. These loans are then repaid over a period of up to 35 years, with interest rates. As mortgages are one of the most expensive financial loans taken out, it is important to get professional consultation and advice to help find the correct mortgage for you. </p>
          <p>Here at Royle Standard, we can assist you by introducing you to a professional (IFA) Independent Financial Advisor for advice for the correct investment product that may meet your needs.</p>

              <li>You also need to be aware that with both a ‘repayment mortgage’ and an ‘interest only mortgage’ it is your responsibility to ensure that you maintain any such repayment vehicle for the term of the mortgage otherwise you may not be able to repay the debt at the end of the term, thus resulting in possible repossession of your home.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>Key Terms:<br>
            <ul class="services">

            <li>More complicated to look after</li>
            <li>Higher risk of bad repayment performance</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Fixed Rate Mortgages</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Monthly payments of Interest or Capital & Interest. The advantage of a fixed rate mortgage is that the interest payment will not change during the fixed term which can typically be anything from two to five years. This means that you can manage your household budget, knowing that your biggest monthly outgoing is not about to increase suddenly.</p>
        <p>There are currently some very good deals available for fixed-rate mortgages, especially for first-time buyers.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Capped Rate Mortgages</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>With a capped rate mortgage, you will know the maximum amount of your interest payment that you will have to pay. Interest rates for this type of mortgage have a maximum rate but no minimum rate. If interest rates rise above your capped rate you pay nothing more, but you also benefit at lower rates as your interest repayments are calculated on this lower rate.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Discounted Rate Mortgages</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>With these mortgages the interest rate is variable (it can rise or fall) with a given discount applied to that rate. The discount period exists for a predetermined period of time; the shorter the time period then generally the bigger the discount and vice versa.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Standard Variable Rate</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Standard variable rate mortgages are when the payments go up and down in line with the intertest rates. Many lenders offer a discounted period within this method. However, there may be penalties for early repayment.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Bank of England base rate tracker</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Base rate trackers are when the interest rates is tracked to the Bank of England rate. Therefore, the payments tend to go up and down in line with the interest rates. This type of mortgage is starting to be offered by many lenders and can also be offered with a discounted period; a discount is given off the current Bank of England rate for a certain period</p>

        <br>
          <ul class="services">

        </p>

        <p>How does an offshore mortgage differ?
        <br>The mortgage is provided by a bank based in an offshore location such as the Isle of Man. This means that if you belong to any of the groups above, you can benefit from offshore tax planning. The principal advantage of an offshore mortgage is that the payment of interest (but not capital) out of non-UK income is not regarded as a taxable remittance to the UK.
        <br>The mortgage interest can also be set against any taxable UK rental income, reducing the UK tax liability for non-UK resident landlords.</p>

        <p>These mortgages are unregulated and therefore unprotected.</p>
